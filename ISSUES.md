## The catalog files many parties and papers as plain `organization`

Seen 2026-10-30 in `bundle.json`: 339 of 390 entries say
`attribution.of.kind: "organization"`, among them dozens of county parties
("Alameda County Democratic Party", "Republican Party of Orange County"),
editorial boards ("Los Angeles Times Editorial Board") and papers ("The Press
Democrat", "Marin Independent Journal", "San Mateo Daily Journal"). The web app
works around it with name rules in `apps/web/src/lib/raceTally.ts`
(`sourceGroup`), but a paper with no "editorial board" in its name lands in
*Other groups* on All slates, and the rules are a guess at what the data should
say. Fix it in `openslate-public-endorsements`, where each org is scraped.
