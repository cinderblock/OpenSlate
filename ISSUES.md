## Hosted app shows raw HTTP 404 errors for elections and ballot lookup

On https://openslate.us there is no `apps/server`, so `/api/elections` and
`/api/ballot` (`apps/web/src/lib/query.ts`, `electionsQueryOptions` and
`ballotQueryOptions`) get a plain 404 from the static-assets worker. The
queries surface that as "Elections lookup failed: HTTP 404" / "Ballot lookup
failed: HTTP 404" in Compose. Only a 501 gets the friendly "isn't configured"
message, and that message talks about `.env`, which means nothing to a visitor.
The README says the hosted mode is manual entry, so the UI should say that
instead of showing an error (or not call the endpoints when no server is
configured).

Note: `ComposePanel.tsx` and `ElectionCombobox.tsx` had uncommitted edits from
another thread on 2026-10-17; check with whoever owns them first.
